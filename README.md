Just got out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Becoming Led Zeppelin, and man, I've got thoughts. You ever walk out of a   and feel like the world got a little weirder while you were gone? That's me right now. Not sure if it was the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 or the three-hour of popcorn inhalation, but here we are. Somewhere between being totally drained and, like, oddly energized. It's like... being caffeinated but also in need of a nap. If that even makes sense. 

Honestly, what a ride. It's not just a  ; it's a Lazarus pit of nostalgia and rock 'n' roll mythos. I mean, okay, sure, it's about Led Zeppelin, but it felt like they were resurrecting some old gods and I was just a mortal caught in the divine wind. At some points, I felt like screaming, Can everyone shut up and just play 'Stairway' already?

The flick digs into the chaos and swagger of Zeppelin's rise, obviously — but the way it does so, more like you're getting a scatterbrain quilt than a straight jacket narrative. One moment you're mesmerized by Jimmy Page’s guitar pyrotechnics, next you’re laughing at Bonham’s wild antics. And then it rains, pours even, and you're back to wondering if rock documentaries should come with an intermission. Oh, and also, I can't be the only one who thinks Robert Plant's hair deserves its own chapter, like seriously? Glorious waves of blond, like some sort of majestic lion king sans Africa symphony.

> But then, there’s this unprecedented silence at times, like they’re implying a “here lies greatness” nonverbal tribute or somethin’. Which, don’t get me wrong, works — if you figured out how to appreciate randomness as art. But it’s like meeting a rock star in person who just briskly nods at you and moves on. A bit infuriating, loser move, but also like, wow they acknowledged my existence, kinda deal. Oh, by the way, I kept momentarily spacing out thinking if I could just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   later. That thought was there, snuggled between Bonham's drum beats.

The point is, this documentary, Beckoning Led Zeppelin — oh wait, nope, Becoming, is it? Whatever! It’s a pretty fever dream, tripping all over memory lane. It's a fuzz-covered shrine for a band that doesn't need worship, but somehow gets it anyway. Would I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it again? Probably, with some friends, a little wine, and lots of patience. And maybe, just maybe, I’ll get something entirely different outta it. Who knows? That's life at 11, I guess.
